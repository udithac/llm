## Introduction

The LLM Experiments Repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of experiments for those interested in learning about and working with large language models. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started or an experienced practitioner seeking advanced challenges, this repository has something for you.

## Experiments

This repository includes the following types of experiments:

- **Basic Experiments**: Introduction to LLMs, basic usage, and understanding of model architectures.
- **Training and Fine-Tuning**: Experiments on training LLMs from scratch and fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific datasets.
- **NLP Tasks**: Experiments covering various NLP tasks such as text generation, classification, summarization, and translation.
- **Advanced Topics**: Experiments on advanced topics such as model optimization, deployment, and integration with other tools and libraries.

Each experiment is located in its own directory under the `experiments` folder, with detailed instructions and necessary scripts.
